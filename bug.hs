This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern matching on a Maybe type without considering the Nothing case, leading to a runtime exception if the Maybe value is Nothing. 
```haskell
myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x * 2
```
This will cause a runtime error if you call `myFunction Nothing`.  Haskell's type system doesn't catch this because the function *appears* to handle all cases, but the pattern match is incomplete.
